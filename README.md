This is assignment 2 in TDT4136 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Here we got the task of implementing the A* algorithm. We illustrated the task using a map of Studenter Samfundet in Trondheim and by trying to find the shortest paths from a room to another given different various obstacles and negative rewards.
